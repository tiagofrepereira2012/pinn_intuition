# Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) - Intuitions

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tiagofrepereira2012/pinn_intuition/blob/main/1.pinn_intuition.ipynb)


This repository contains a pytorch implementation of this nice PINN tutorial wrote by [Ian Henderson](https://towardsdatascience.com/physics-informed-neural-networks-pinns-an-intuitive-guide-fff138069563).
In his blog post he tries to regularize NN trained on projectile motion data by adding a loss term that enforces the physics of the problem.

The goal of this repository is to provide a more intuitive explanation of the PINN concept and how it works and, most important, to educate myself as well.
